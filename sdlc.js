// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "this is the second step where developers see they have all of the requirements for their project met."
const design = "this is the third step where developers make a design for what they want their finished product to look like."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step in which the code is actually implemented into working code."
const testingAndIntegration = "this is the fifth step where the code is tested for bugs and then integrated into what it needs to be integrated into."
const Maintain = "this is the sixth step where developers make sure to keep their service running and make sure missed bugs get fixed. This is not the last step as when finished we go back to step 1 or other steps to make sure the service gets updated and stays free of bugs."
